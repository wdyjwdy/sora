CDN reduces the distance between the user and the assets.

## Lookup

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Client ->> Local: Domain Name
  Local ->> DNS: Domain Name
  DNS ->> Local: CDN Authoritative Server IP
  Local ->> CDN Auth: Domain Name
  CDN Auth ->> Local: CDN Content Server IP
  Local ->> Client: CDN Content Server IP
```

## Cluster Selection Strategies

1. **Geographically closest**: select the CDN cluster that is closest to the user's location based on their IP address.
2. **RTT closest**: select the CDN cluster that has the lowest round-trip time to the user's location.

## Cache Update

If the CDN does not storing the assets or the assets are expired, then the assets needs to be updated.

1. **Push**: manually push the assets to the origin server, then propagate to other CDN
2. **Pull**: CDN automatically pull the assets from the origin server (or another CDN cluster)
